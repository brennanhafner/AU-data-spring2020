# Assignment 2: Create a Dataset

## By Brennan Hafner

In the United States farmers are predominantly men, according to the USDA Census of Agriculture. This creates barriers to women entering and being engaged in the field and gaining access to resources like loans. However, the number of women farmers has been steadily increasing, at least the number of women who recognize themselves as farmers. I know several women, including my mother, who have done a lot of work on the family farm for years but would never self-identify as a farmer. This makes me curious about the limitations of the data on women farmers and if the number would be much higher if women, especially those  with male farming partners, didn’t downplay their roles. I am also curious as to why women in farming families don’t consider themselves farmers. For example: Do some women think their duties are less important to the operation and therefore not worthy of the title?
There are timely conversations happening around gender roles and the added tasks and burdens women often take on. I’m interested in if there’s a story applying this conversation to rural, specifically farming, populations. In addition, the most recent Census of Agriculture (taken every 5 years) was just released in 2019, showing changes in farmer demographics that can be fleshed out.

Here are the features I'll be collecting, and an explanation of why:

* Name
* Age
* Number of years on the farm (I want to see if a woman is more likely to identify as a farmer the longer she lives on the farm)
* Does she consider herself a farmer
* If no, why
* Did she identify as a farmer in the last Census of Ag
* Do/Did she have an off-farm career
* Would she consider the time she spends on the farm equivalent to full-time, part-time, or less than part-time (I want to see if amount of hours spent helping on the farm impacts identification.)
* Is she involved in decion making on the farm
* Gender of partner (Ms. Opatick-Murray indicated that often women she speaks to put the title of farmer on a pedastool and don't want to suggest they are at the same level as their farming partner. I want to see if gender has anything to do with this.)
* Has anyone told her she is a farmer (I want to see others' perspective of their role to better understand downplaying of their role on the farm)
* Is the farm their family’s or their partner’s family’s (I'm curious if family connection impacts identification)
* Type of farming operation

There are now programs that hold women-only learning circles for women farmers and landowners to network, gain access to resources, and share experiences. I talked with a woman who facilitates some of these circles, April Ann Opatik-Murray, who explained it is very common for women who attend the circles not to consider themselves farmers. I will start collecting data by looking through the essay testimonials and survey responses of women who attended Opatik-Murray’s circles and expanding to interview other women in farm families, specifically those who haven’t actively sought out resources and conversations, by contacting local farm bureaus.
