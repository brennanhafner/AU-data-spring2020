It is a common joke among Iowans that representatives stay in office so long because Iowans are loyal and they often vote off name recognition. Though I don't think this is true, I heard a lot of these conversations after Rep. Steve King won his district again in 2018 despite backlash from both major parties on his anti-immigration comments.

I found that despite the resulting slim voting margins, Rep. King's competition, J.D. Scholten, raised significantly more money in individual contributions than King (about 7 times). However, 75% of Scholten's individuals were from outside the state versus just 27% for King. Scholten is running agains Rep. King again in 2020. He said in an interview with the New York Times that he know how to win now. I'm curious what his strategy is to catch the attention of Iowa individual voters and donors.

To follow up on this story, I would interview people runnng Scholten's campaign to see how their strategy is changed for the 2020 race and how/if it includes getting more in-state supporters. I would also interview people from Rep. King's 2018 campaign to see their explanaton for such significantly lower individual donations and if they name recognition is a fact they consider, especially when trying to raise money and spending it on things like ads during the race (Scholten spent 3 times what King did in the last election).

In order to find my story, I did the following:

* Searched the FEC database for all donations to the Scholten 2018 campaign

* I did the same for King's 2018 campaign

* To bot CSV's I:

  * Added the total amount in individual contributions

  * Filtered the dataset to only include unique donors and found the total number

  * Filtered the dataset to only include unique Iowa donors and calculated the total number

  * Calculated the percent of total donors that were from out of state
  
  Headline: To win this time, Scholten will have to break the King-Iowa cycle
  
  Nut Graf: Last election, Scholten brought in seven times the money that King did, but to win this time around Scholten needs to focus on making sure that support is coming from Iowans.
