* Expanded rows so could read

* Deleted Title and moved column headers to the first row of the document


* Deleted extra “y” in label of column EM


* Filtered the team column to ensure there were no repeats

* Checked for merged cells
* Searched for blank entries (Found one at row 17 for “punt return touchdowns”. Since 0 was an option I figured the blank should have been a zero it just wasn’t filled in, but I confirmed this number [here](https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/schools/buffalo/2019.html)

* Made an extra column for the team’s conference(Added a new blank column, using “text to column” delineated with a “(“, 2 entries had both the state and the conference in parenthesis, so I had to move the state back to the original column (Miami, FL and Miami, OH))

* Added “conference” as the label for the new column

* Removed the closing parenthesis from the new Conference column I made

* Changed the loss number to numerals instead of months in Sublime text by adding an apostrophe before each entry in the win-loss column

* Split win-loss column into one for wins and one for loses
