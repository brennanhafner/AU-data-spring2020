## Story Idea 1
**What percentage of farms that have shut down in the last year stay in agriculture?**

The number of farm bankruptcies and closing are at a high in the U.S. as many small-scale farms struggle too survive from trade, markets, bigger farm, and climate change pressures. There have been articles reporting on these trends and even profiling farming families who are shutting the farm down. However, there has been less written about what happens to the farm and farmland after the family shuts down and leaves. The U.S. loses around three acres of farmland every minute, most often to development. I want to see what percentage of small-scale farms are turned into development when they shut down and what happens to them if they arenâ€™t sold to developers.

### Data Reporting Critique ###

[Wisconsin lost more than 1,500 dairy farms in 2 years](https://www.farmprogress.com/commentary/wisconsin-lost-more-1500-dairy-farms-2-years?NL=FP-004_NEW&Issue=FP-004_NEW_20200115_FP-004_NEW_991&sfvc4enews=42&cl=article_1&utm_rid=CPG02000002310793&utm_campaign=45767&utm_medium=email&elq2=9350b5d7b6144b3984f03c1f7168a22d)

**Objective: Clarity and accuracy**
* Were you able to immediately identify the central insight the reporter was trying to communicate? Answer on a 1-5 scale, with 5 being excellent and 1 being below expectations.
5, I was immediately able to identify the central insight the reporter was trying to make from the data in the article - that Wisconsin lost a lot of farms in the last two years. In the first paragraph of the article it is identified why and why it's a big deal - Wisconsin is a big dairy state and dairy prices have dropped.

* Were you able to quickly understand how you would navigate the data? Again, use a 5- point scale with 5 = excellent 
3, It was not difficult to find and recognize the data being used, but it is a short article packed with a lot of numbers that are only added into text and never displayed or analyzed. I think a more effective way to help readers visualize and understand the gravity of the trends would be to show a columns graph of the loss of farms over time.


* Using your own knowledge and critical thinking abilities, do you think the data was accurate? 1-5, with 5 most accurate 
4, the piece is an informative piece that doesn't overtly show a judgement on the situation and it is published in a respectable ag publication that focuses mostly on markets and data. However, the author does not source most of the numbers in the article. I don't question any of the numbers specificaly, but I would like to know where they came from. She did a good job of incorporating and explaining the data she used. I would suggest checking with the Wisconsin State Extension for accuracy of her data and more data to put the numbers she uses into perspective.

**Objective: Quality**

* Regardless of the form that the graphic/story takes, was it executed at a high degree of quality? (Rank 1-5, with five excellent.)
2, For the quick, report a stat article that it is the date is shown early and the purpose of it is clear. However, the data could have been better represented visually. Yes, it is a short article, but a graphic could have helped make it more clear while keeping the text short.

* Consider some tasks a data story must do well: (present, compare, organize, correlate)
This article presented the data (very quickly and well to show why it was important and a story) and correlated it to other pieces of data (like the drop in milk prices) to help paint a picture of the "why" where the data came from. However, a visual element could have done a better job of representing the comparison task of the data story and given the healdline stat more gravity and context. Finally, the article organizes relevant data in that the author brings it together in one article and walks the reader through it, but the walk through happens pretty quickly and again a visual would have made it more effective organizationally.
