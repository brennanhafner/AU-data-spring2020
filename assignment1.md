## Story Idea 1
**What percentage of farms that have shut down in the last year stay in agriculture?**

The number of farm bankruptcies and closing are at a high in the U.S. as many small-scale farms struggle too survive from trade, markets, bigger farm, and climate change pressures. There have been articles reporting on these trends and even profiling farming families who are shutting the farm down. However, there has been less written about what happens to the farm and farmland after the family shuts down and leaves. The U.S. loses around three acres of farmland every minute, most often to development. I want to see what percentage of small-scale farms are turned into development when they shut down and what happens to them if they arenâ€™t sold to developers.

### Data Reporting Critique ###

[Wisconsin lost more than 1,500 dairy farms in 2 years](https://www.farmprogress.com/commentary/wisconsin-lost-more-1500-dairy-farms-2-years?NL=FP-004_NEW&Issue=FP-004_NEW_20200115_FP-004_NEW_991&sfvc4enews=42&cl=article_1&utm_rid=CPG02000002310793&utm_campaign=45767&utm_medium=email&elq2=9350b5d7b6144b3984f03c1f7168a22d)

**Objective: Clarity and accuracy**
* Were you able to immediately identify the central insight the reporter was trying to communicate? Answer on a 1-5 scale, with 5 being excellent and 1 being below expectations.

5, I was immediately able to identify the central insight the reporter was trying to make from the data in the article - that Wisconsin lost a lot of farms in the last two years. In the first paragraph of the article it is identified why and why it's a big deal - Wisconsin is a big dairy state and dairy prices have dropped.

* Were you able to quickly understand how you would navigate the data? Again, use a 5- point scale with 5 = excellent 

3, It was not difficult to find and recognize the data being used, but it is a short article packed with a lot of numbers that are only added into text and never displayed or analyzed. I think a more effective way to help readers visualize and understand the gravity of the trends would be to show a columns graph of the loss of farms over time.


* Using your own knowledge and critical thinking abilities, do you think the data was accurate? 1-5, with 5 most accurate 

4, the piece is an informative piece that doesn't overtly show a judgement on the situation and it is published in a respectable ag publication that focuses mostly on markets and data. However, the author does not source most of the numbers in the article. I don't question any of the numbers specificaly, but I would like to know where they came from. She did a good job of incorporating and explaining the data she used. I would suggest checking with the Wisconsin State Extension for accuracy of her data and more data to put the numbers she uses into perspective.

**Objective: Quality**

* Regardless of the form that the graphic/story takes, was it executed at a high degree of quality? (Rank 1-5, with five excellent.)

2, For the quick, report a stat article that it is the date is shown early and the purpose of it is clear. However, the data could have been better represented visually. Yes, it is a short article, but a graphic could have helped make it more clear while keeping the text short.

* Consider some tasks a data story must do well: (present, compare, organize, correlate)

This article presented the data (very quickly and well to show why it was important and a story) and correlated it to other pieces of data (like the drop in milk prices) to help paint a picture of the "why" where the data came from. However, a visual element could have done a better job of representing the comparison task of the data story and given the healdline stat more gravity and context. Finally, the article organizes relevant data in that the author brings it together in one article and walks the reader through it, but the walk through happens pretty quickly and again a visual would have made it more effective organizationally.

**Objective: Creativity**

* Did the piece use some creative elements to good effect? As in, to emphasize those areas that could draw someone in, or to add detail where needed, but not just random visual or story junk that distracts you?

1, The article did not use any creative elements to draw the reader in. Even the one photo at the beginning looks like a stock photo.

## Story Idea 2

**What is the demographic make-up of farmers who get money from Farm Bill conservatin programs?**

When President Trump provided bailout money for farmers during the trade war there were several good articles looking at which farmers those payouts went to and who got what amount. But this is conversation can and should be applied to other parts of the agriculture sector as well. Specifically related to conservation programs in the Farm Bill. Farmers often get a bad wrap when it comes to environmental issues, but there are federal programs to help make their operations more environmentally-friendly. However, I've heard reports that there is not enough bandwith or funding within those programs and thousands of applications are never accepted. I want to know whose applications get accepted and why. This conversation is also important as populations of non-white and non-male farmers rise but continue to face institutional barriers to needed assets like loans and federal programs.

### Data Reporting Critique ###

[Farmers Got Billions From Taxpayers In 2019, And Hardly Anyone Objected](https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2019/12/31/790261705/farmers-got-billions-from-taxpayers-in-2019-and-hardly-anyone-objected)

**Objective: Clarity and accuracy**
* Were you able to immediately identify the central insight the reporter was trying to communicate? Answer on a 1-5 scale, with 5 being excellent and 1 being below expectations.

4, The data was hinted at in the headline and then a comparison of why the dollar amount is significant and should be paid attention to came very quickly in the article, along with a visual. However, I wish the analysis on who received the money was better incorporated. I'm afraid how the data is presented now could paint the wrong picture of all farmers and the money they received. They mention that only a few people got most of the money and why, but not what it looks like for those who didn't get the money.

* Were you able to quickly understand how you would navigate the data? Again, use a 5- point scale with 5 = excellent 

4, It was not difficult to find and recognize the data being used, especially with the visual early in the article. The stats that were in-line were incorporated well and the trasitions from stat to stat helped me understand why the author was presenting each data piece to me. I think there could have been one more graphic to show comparisons within the bailout money or how the bailout amount compared to bailout amounts to other industries in the past in addition to the graph at the beginning of the article.


* Using your own knowledge and critical thinking abilities, do you think the data was accurate? 1-5, with 5 most accurate 

4, The piece referneces where all its data came from. Plus, the story works heavily off USDA data, but they also analyse and contextualize that data through reports from other sources as a check. I think everything that needed to be explained was explained.

**Objective: Quality**

* Regardless of the form that the graphic/story takes, was it executed at a high degree of quality? (Rank 1-5, with five excellent.)

4, The article got to the point and the graphic helped to visualize that point. They also did a good job of pointing out how the dollar amount impacts an every-day person in America, how it compares to similar situations, and what specifics within the big number could be overlooked. As far as improvements, they reference a farmer at the beginning of the article and then kind of dropped them. I wish we could have seen more of what the numbers looked like related to a specific farmer.

* Consider some tasks a data story must do well: (present, compare, organize, correlate)

The graph did a good job of presenting a stat that was important to the article but I think difficult to explain in writing. It used colors well to make a comparison quickly and organized it in a way that could be understood at a glance. 

**Objective: Type and Color**

I think the graph used type and colors well. Using gray for the total really helped the orange of the trade numbers standout, drawing the reader's attention. Also, the point was to show how extreme the number is, so I think using a "hot" color was a great choice. Everything looked uniform and like it belonged, including the labels at the peaks of the differnt colors (which was a great decision because I think the graph could have been really confusing without them). I also liked that the peak labels matched the color of the data for connection. Color - 5, Type - 4 (the gray color is a little difficult to read, but I like that it sets you up to look at the orange and not be distracted or overwhelmed by the rest of the graphic.

**Objective: Creativity**

* Did the piece use some creative elements to good effect? As in, to emphasize those areas that could draw someone in, or to add detail where needed, but not just random visual or story junk that distracts you?

2, The article didn't really utilize creative elements. The graph was definitely helpful, but it was the only visual component.
