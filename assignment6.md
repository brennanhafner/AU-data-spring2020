### Steps for cleaning and analyzing

* Filtered the data to only include farms in the U.S. 

* Expanded rows

* Searched for and filled in blanks in "required" operational and date columns

* Used text to cell to split the certification date into day, month, and year

* created a pivot table to find the number of new certifications per year and by state

### Questions and answers

**Did the extra financial struggles in the agriculture industry the past two years negatively impact the number of organic certifications pursued and rewarded?**

No, the number of organic certifications has continued to increase for the past five years.

**Are there any states that have no organically-certified farms?**

No, however Alaska only has one and there hasn't been a new certification since 2012.

**The USDA has certification records back until 1973. How long did it take for farms in the Midwest (traditionally more conventional farmers operating on a large scale) to begin receiving certifications for using organic practices?**

The first certification in a Midwest state (Nebraska) was in 1987. And the numbers are slow to pick up from there for several years.By that year California already had over 25 certified farms. This is not to say some Midwest farms couldn't have been farming organically, they just did not get certified.

### Sample headline and nut graf

Despite hardships, the rate of farmers certifying organic remains constant
With market insecurities, trade wars, and climate change adding stress and finacial burdens, it can be difficult to pay for and keep up with the extensive organic certification process with the USDA, but farmers are continuing to do it. 

*I would do further research and interviews to see if this is worth it. Once farmers become certified (in the past two years) are they gaining the new customers and markets needed to stay afloat and make the record keeping, labeling process, and extra costs of licensing etc. worth it?*
