I plan to look at the progress of rural broadband expansion accross the U.S. and compare it to development trends on rural farmland. What I want to find is if rural (specifically agriculture-centered) communities gain broadband quicker when it is paired with development/more people moving to the area. I am also interested if this trend exists whether it is creating a dilemma for farmers who need broadband to advance the technology and efficiency of their operations, but are negatively impacted by development surrounding and breaking up the land they are trying to farm.

To do this I will anaylze rural broadband availability and plans of expansion from the FCC and development on and around farmland from the American Farmland Trust as well as the USDA Census of Agriculture. 

I could visualize through colored mapping where farmland loss and broadband connectivity overlap accross the U.S. I could also visualize if distance from an urban center impacts the amount of time communites have to wait for broadband connectivity.

This is timely because rural broadband has been a topic of conversation a number of fields including agriculture, civil rights, and technology. Additionally, a bill was introduced in May in the House to amend the 1936 Rural Electrification Act to target broadband access.

For sources, I could talk with farmers whose operations are in need of broadband access and who are facing the pressures of development. I could talk with researchers at American Farmland Trust who mapped loss of farmland. I could talk with experts about how internet is connected to rural communites and how those decisions are made. I could also talk with organizations focused on broadband availability for rural communities.
